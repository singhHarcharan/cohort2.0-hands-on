Important Question: 

How the crawlers (Google Bot or others) will make the website index (SEO optimized) 
if the application have the loader at the first render in the NextJS app and not directly hydrating the 
website with the data ? 

Answer: 
What would you compromise ? Either Loader or SEO optimized website ?
Also, content of website which doesn’t get changed frequently is generated by static generation 
so, it automatically becomes SEO optimized as we not fetching frontend dynamically everytime.ˀ
